Junior Software Developer at Marionette XR

I have a great interest in developing for Virtual Reality. 

I am experienced in Object Orientated Programming, Unity 3D and working in a team. Furthermore, I enjoy 3D modeling/animation.

My plan is to move my course work and hobby projects here for display but that might take a while! In the meantime you can read about my accademic projects and other work on my linkedin
