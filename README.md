Junior Software Developer at ̶M̶a̶r̶i̶o̶n̶e̶t̶t̶e̶ ̶X̶R̶  Aveva part of ERM R&D 

I have a great interest in developing for Virtual Reality. 

I have been working with Unity 3D/C# for over 5 years now and enjoy being part of a team! Furthermore, I have a bit of experience with simple 3D modeling/animation.

My plan is to move my course work and hobby projects here for display but that might take a while! In the meantime you can read about my accademic projects and other work on my linkedin
